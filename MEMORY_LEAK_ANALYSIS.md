# Memory Leak Analysis & Fixes

## Overview
Analysis of the ReactiveEventSource library revealed several potential memory leak issues. This document outlines the problems found and the solutions implemented.

## Memory Leak Issues Identified

### 1. **Incomplete Subscription Cleanup**
- **Problem**: Internal subscriptions created in `on()` and `setupEventForwarding()` methods were not properly tracked and cleaned up
- **Impact**: Subscriptions could remain active even after the EventSource was closed, preventing garbage collection
- **Fix**: Added `eventSubscriptions` Map to track all subscriptions and ensure proper cleanup in `close()`

### 2. **Subject Management Issues**
- **Problem**: ReplaySubjects were stored indefinitely without proper lifecycle management
- **Impact**: Subjects could retain references to events and prevent memory cleanup
- **Fix**: Enhanced subject cleanup with explicit completion checks and proper Map clearing

### 3. **Lack of State Management**
- **Problem**: No protection against operations on already-destroyed instances
- **Impact**: Could lead to resource leaks and unexpected behavior
- **Fix**: Added `isDestroyed` flag to prevent operations on closed instances

### 4. **Event Listener Cleanup**
- **Problem**: EventSource event listeners weren't explicitly managed during cleanup
- **Impact**: Potential for dangling event listeners preventing garbage collection
- **Fix**: Improved EventSource cleanup sequence with proper resource management

### 5. **Race Conditions in Cleanup**
- **Problem**: Potential race conditions between subscription creation and cleanup
- **Impact**: Subscriptions created during cleanup might not be properly managed
- **Fix**: Added null/undefined checks and subscription state validation

## Implemented Solutions

### Enhanced Cleanup Mechanism
```typescript
// Added comprehensive cleanup in close() method
public close(): void {
  if (this.isDestroyed) {
    return;
  }
  
  this.isDestroyed = true;
  
  // Close EventSource first
  if (this.lastEventSource) {
    this.lastEventSource.close();
  }
  
  // Clean up all subscriptions
  this.eventSubscriptions.forEach(subscription => {
    if (!subscription.closed) {
      subscription.unsubscribe();
    }
  });
  this.eventSubscriptions.clear();
  
  // Complete and clean up all subjects
  this.eventSubjects.forEach(subject => {
    if (!subject.closed) {
      subject.complete();
    }
  });
  this.eventSubjects.clear();
  
  // Finally complete the destroy subject
  if (!this.destroy$.closed) {
    this.destroy$.next();
    this.destroy$.complete();
  }
}
```

### Subscription Tracking
```typescript
// Added Map to track internal subscriptions
private readonly eventSubscriptions = new Map<string, Subscription>();

// Store subscriptions for proper cleanup
this.eventSubscriptions.set(eventType, subscription);
```

### State Protection
```typescript
// Added state checking to prevent operations on destroyed instances
if (this.isDestroyed) {
  return EMPTY;
}
```

### Improved Error Handling
```typescript
// Enhanced subscription handlers with proper error handling
.subscribe({
  next: (event: MessageEvent) => {
    const subject = this.eventSubjects.get(eventType);
    if (subject && !subject.closed) {
      subject.next(event);
    }
  },
  error: (err: any) => {
    const subject = this.eventSubjects.get(eventType);
    if (subject && !subject.closed) {
      subject.error(err);
    }
  },
  complete: () => {
    const subject = this.eventSubjects.get(eventType);
    if (subject && !subject.closed) {
      subject.complete();
    }
  }
});
```

## Testing
Added comprehensive memory leak prevention tests covering:
- Multiple `close()` calls
- Subscription after close
- Subscription cleanup verification
- Rapid subscribe/unsubscribe cycles
- State protection after destruction

## Benefits of the Fixes

1. **Memory Leak Prevention**: All subscriptions and subjects are properly cleaned up
2. **Resource Management**: EventSource instances are properly disposed
3. **State Safety**: Operations on destroyed instances are safely handled
4. **Error Resilience**: Better error handling prevents resource leaks
5. **Performance**: Reduced memory footprint and better garbage collection

## Recommendations for Usage

1. **Always call `close()`**: Ensure `close()` is called when the ReactiveEventSource is no longer needed
2. **Unsubscribe observables**: Always unsubscribe from returned observables when done
3. **Monitor memory usage**: Use browser dev tools to monitor memory usage in long-running applications
4. **Avoid multiple instances**: Reuse ReactiveEventSource instances when possible

## Verification
All existing tests pass, and new memory leak prevention tests have been added to ensure the fixes work correctly. The implementation now provides robust protection against common memory leak scenarios in RxJS-based EventSource wrappers.
